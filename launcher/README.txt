TurboShell.exe is just a copy of WinRun4J with modified icon.
	http://winrun4j.sourceforge.net/

TurboShellLauncher.exe is a compiled AutoIt script. Au3 file is the source code.
	NB: MAY trigger a false-positive on lousy security software.

If you don't trust any of these EXE's and can't be bothered compiling them 
yourself, just run .\lib\turboshell*.jar yourself.
